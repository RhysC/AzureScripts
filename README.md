Welcome to the AzureScripts
============

*Advise and Generic reusable scripts for Windows Azure management*


This is a collection of links, scripts and advise on how to get by with Windows Azure cloud services using the PowerShell commands. Please see the wiki for advice and browse or donload the code to see examples and get some reusable scripts.

Some of this advice is from the experiences of various team members I currently or have worked with as well as blog, guides etc. I hope this can become a community best practice and a place for reusable scripts so we can reduce the ramp up time in learning how to manage your azure resources and in doing so *reduce the cost of managing said resources*.

Not everything on here will be completely correct and there is bound to be plenty of room for improvement - This is why I choose to use a public Github repo to push this information out. If you see things that can be improved please feel free to fork this repo, make the appropriate changes and submit a pull request.
